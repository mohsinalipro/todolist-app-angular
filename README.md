# Todo List

This is a test project to demonstrate using Angular 6+. It contains a simple list of Todo tasks. Each task can be marked completed and can be deleted. It also contains a form to add new Todo task to the list.

## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mohsinalipro/todolist-app-angular
cd todolist-app-angular
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files, and runs `localhost` on port `5000`.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.
